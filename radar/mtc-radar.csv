Today, Scrumban is a management framework that emerges when teams employ Scrum as their chosen way of working and use the Kanban Method as a lens through which to view, understand and continuously improve how they work."CI/CD Pipeline,trial,Techniques,FALSE,"The use of continuous delivery pipelines to orchestrate the release process for software has become a mainstream concept. However, automatically testing changes to infrastructure code isn’t as widely understood. Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) tools can be used to test server configuration (e.g., Chef cookbooks, Puppet modules, Ansible playbooks), server image building (e.g., Packer), environment provisioning (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) and integration of environments. The use of pipelines for infrastructure as code enables errors to be found before changes are applied to operational environments — including environments used for development and testing. They also offer a way to ensure that infrastructure tooling is run consistently, from CI/CD agents, as opposed to being run from individual workstations. Some challenges remain, however, such as the longer feedback loops associated with standing up containers and virtual machines. Still, we've found this to be a valuable technique."Graph QL,assess,Techniques,TRUE,"One pattern that comes up again and again when building microservice-style architectures is how to handle the aggregation of many resources server-side. In recent years, we've seen the emergence of a number of patterns such as Backend for Frontend (BFF) and tools such as Falcor to address this. Our teams have started using GraphQL for server-side resource aggregation instead. This differs from the usual mode of using GraphQL where clients directly query a GraphQL server. When using this technique, the services continue to expose RESTful APIs but under-the-hood aggregate services use GraphQL resolvers as the implementation for stitching resources from other services. This technique simplifies the internal implementation of aggregate services or BFFs by using GraphQL."Hypermedia,adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"Pattern that enables navigation of clients over REST resources. Clients are not required to know the details of the interface they will access as this is provided at runtime."ULFF,assess,Techniques,FALSE,"One problem with observability in a highly distributed microservices architecture is the choice between logging everything — and taking up huge amounts of storage space — or randomly sampling logs and potentially missing important events. Recently, we’ve noticed a technique that offers a compromise between these two solutions. Set the log level per request via a parameter passed in through the tracing header. Using a tracing framework, possibly based on the OpenTracing standard, you can pass a correlation id from service to service in a single transaction. You can even inject other data, such as the desired log level, at the initiating transaction and pass it along with the tracing information. This ensures that the additional data collected corresponds to a single user transaction as it flows through the system. This is also a useful technique for debugging, since services might be paused or otherwise modified on a transaction-by-transaction basis."Java,adopt,Platforms,FALSE,Platform where APIGee runtime is executedKubernetes,adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"Since we last mentioned Kubernetes in the Radar, it has become the default solution for most of our clients when deploying containers into a cluster of machines. The alternatives didn’t capture as much mindshare, and in some cases our clients are even changing their ‘engine’ to Kubernetes. Kubernetes has become the container orchestration platform of choice for major public cloud platforms, including Microsoft's Azure Container Service and Google Cloud (see the GKE blip). And there are many useful products enriching the fast-growing Kubernetes ecosystem.
